# Instagram-fake-spammer-genuine-Accounts
With the growing influence of social media platforms like Instagram, the presence of fake and spammer accounts has become a significant concern. These accounts often exhibit different behavioral patterns compared to genuine users, such as unusual follower counts, posting frequency, bio characteristics, or profile completeness.

This project aims to analyze and classify Instagram accounts into categories like fake, spammer, and genuine based on a variety of features, 
including:

Number of posts, followers, and followings
Presence of profile pictures and external links
Length and patterns in usernames, full names, and bios
Account privacy settings (public vs. private)
Using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), we evaluate these features to identify accounts that show suspicious or automated behavior.

My goal is to develop a system that not only helps in automatically detecting fake or spam accounts, but also enhances the overall integrity of the platform by providing insights into distinguishing genuine users from malicious ones. Through feature engineering, visualization, and model evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1-score), this analysis contributes to building a robust classification system for social media account authenticity.
